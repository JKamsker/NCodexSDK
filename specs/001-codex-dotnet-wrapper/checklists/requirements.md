# Specification Quality Checklist: NCodexSDK - CLI Wrapper Library

**Purpose**: Validate specification completeness and quality before proceeding to planning  
**Created**: November 20, 2025  
**Feature**: [spec.md](../spec.md)

## Content Quality

- [x] No low-level API details (language/framework mentions kept minimal and only for context)
- [x] Focused on user value and business needs
- [x] Written for non-technical stakeholders
- [x] All mandatory sections completed

## Requirement Completeness

- [x] No [NEEDS CLARIFICATION] markers remain
- [x] Requirements are testable and unambiguous
- [x] Success criteria are measurable
- [x] Success criteria are technology-agnostic (no low-level implementation details)
- [x] All acceptance scenarios are defined
- [x] Edge cases are identified
- [x] Scope is clearly bounded
- [x] Dependencies and assumptions identified

## Feature Readiness

- [x] All functional requirements have clear acceptance criteria
- [x] User scenarios cover primary flows
- [x] Feature meets measurable outcomes defined in Success Criteria
- [x] No low-level implementation details leak into specification

## Validation Summary

**Status**: ✅ PASSED

All checklist items have been validated and pass quality standards. The specification:

- Clearly defines 5 prioritized user stories covering start session, resume session, list sessions, configure options, and resource cleanup
- Contains 25 functional requirements that are testable and unambiguous
- Defines 10 measurable success criteria that are technology-agnostic
- Identifies 13 key domain entities
- Documents comprehensive edge cases for error scenarios
- Clearly states assumptions about Codex CLI installation and behavior
- Explicitly scopes what is included and excluded

The specification avoids low-level API code details while preserving necessary platform/context assumptions (e.g., .NET target, JSONL format, Codex CLI paths and options).

## Notes

Specification is ready for `/speckit.plan` phase.
