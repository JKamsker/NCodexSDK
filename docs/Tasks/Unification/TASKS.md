# Unification follow-ups

Source notes: `docs/Tasks/Unification/Followup.md`

- [x] Fix `CodexModel` constants vs unit tests mismatch (keep names stable; add new 5.2 constants if needed)
- [x] Extract shared `Stdio` + `JsonRpc` bootstrap used by AppServer/McpServer clients and factories
- [x] Factor common DI registrations into one shared helper
- [x] Fix CI “Prepare NuGet README” step to rewrite `src/NCodexSDK/README.md` (not repo root `README.md`)
- [x] Align demo `Microsoft.Extensions.Logging.Console` package versions with the library stack
- [x] Run tests/build to validate changes
