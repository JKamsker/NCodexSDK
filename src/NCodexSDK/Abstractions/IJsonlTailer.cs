/// Defines an abstraction for tailing JSONL (JSON Lines) files.

/// <remarks>
/// This interface provides functionality similar to the Unix 'tail -f' command,
/// continuously reading new lines appended to a JSONL file. It's designed for
/// monitoring Codex session logs that are actively being written.

    /// Tails a JSONL file, yielding new lines as they are written to the file.

    /// An async enumerable that yields each new line from the file as a string.
    /// Lines are yielded without the trailing newline character.

    /// once the existing content has been read to the end of the file.

    /// This method follows the file as it grows, similar to 'tail -f'. It handles:

    /// <item><description>Polling for new content when the end of file is reached</description></item>

    /// <item><description>Gracefully stopping when cancellation is requested</description></item>
    /// </list>
    /// The enumeration continues until the file is no longer accessible, the process writing to it exits,
    /// or the operation is canceled. Empty lines are included in the output.
